Lab report for Lab #2 

# Lab Summary
For this lab we learned a few things, how to create a Vivado project, setting up that project for a Basys board, the basics of the interface of Vivado, and how to assign leds to switches on the board.

# Lab Questions
# 1 - Describe the stages of building a Verilog project in Vivado.
There are a few stages to building a Verilog project in Vivado: 
- Setting up the project
- Simulating the circuit
- Implementing the code onto the circuit
- Testing the code that you've written to see if what you wrote achieved what it was supposed to.

# 2 - What is the value in looking at the elaborated design schematic?
It allows you to visually see how everything is connected and what the results of your code would be. With a small amount of code like in our lab this week it doesn't have a ton of value since we know exactly what is connected to what (in our case its the switch connected to a led) but when there is a lot of switches connected to a lot of other leds or other things on the board it makes it a lot easier to see what is doing what. 

# 3 - Why should we simulate our designs frequently? What does the simulation do?
By simulating our designs frequently we can see if our code is doing what it is supposed to before we implement it onto the board itself. By doing this it saves us time by not having to wait for the code to be programmed onto the board and we can see the results faster using the wavelengths. 

All of my groups code is zipped in the repository.
